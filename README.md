# Period-3 An introduction to Cross-Platform App Development with React Native

## Explain Pros & Cons with React Native + Expo used to implement a Mobile App for Android and IOS, compared to using the Native Tools/languages for the two platforms.
Pros: 
- You only have one app for all platforms
- Expo API makes sure you don't have to worry about whether its IOS or Android
Cons:
- Less functionality
- Slower performance wise

## What is meant by the React Native Paradigm "Learn once, write anywhere" compared to for example the original (now dead) idea with Java "Write Once, run everywhere". 
It means that you only have to learn React Native to be able to build applications on all platforms. 
What is different from the Java approach is that it doesn't cross compile.

## In React Native, which parts of your code gets compiled to Native Code (Widgets) and which parts do NOT?

## Explain the basic building block in a React Native Application and the difference(s) between a React Application and a React Native App.
The most basic building block in React Native is <View> tags which is like <Div> tags

## Explain and demonstrate ways to handle User Input in a React Native Application
You can handle User Input in React Native with <TextInput> tags

## Explain and demonstrate how to handle state in a React Native Application
You can handle state with useState

## Explain and demonstrate how to communicate with external servers, in a React Native Application
You can use fetch to handle API communication with backend servers

## Explain and Demonstrate ways to debug a React Native Application

## Explain and demonstrate how to use Native Device Features in a React Native/Expo app.

## Explain and demonstrate a React Native Client that uses geo-components (Location, MapView, etc.)

## Demonstrate both server and client-side, of the geo-related parts of your implementation of the ongoing semester case.
